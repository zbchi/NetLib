## Features

- **Learning-Friendly**: The code is cleanly structured with detailed comments, making it easy for learners to understand and experiment with Linux network programming.
- **High Performance**: Built on an event-driven and non-blocking I/O model, the library supports high concurrency and high-throughput network communication.
- **Modular Design**: The modular design allows learners to grasp different networking concepts step by step.
- **Thread Safety**: Ensures data consistency and safety in multi-threaded environments.
- **Optimized Memory Management**: Uses memory pooling techniques to reduce allocation overhead and improve performance.

## Key Features

- **TCP/UDP Protocol Support**: Supports common TCP and UDP protocols, suitable for various networking scenarios.
- **Multiplexing**: Utilizes efficient I/O multiplexing mechanisms like `epoll` to handle large numbers of concurrent connections.
- **Asynchronous I/O**: Supports asynchronous I/O operations to enhance responsiveness and processing efficiency.
- **Timer Support**: Includes a built-in timer system for handling scheduled tasks.
